<p>
She walks in beauty, like the night </br>
Of cloudless climes and starry skies; </br>
And all that's best of dark and bright </br>
Meet in her aspect and her eyes: </br>
Thus mellow'd to that tender light </br>
Which heaven to gaudy day denies. </br>
</p>

<p>
One shade the more, one ray the less, </br>
Had half impaired the nameless grace </br>
Which waves in every raven tress, </br>
Or softly lightens o'er her face; </br>
Where thoughts serenely sweet express </br>
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place. </br>
</p>

<p>
And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, </br>
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent, </br>
The smiles that win, the tints that glow, </br>
But tell of days in goodness spent, </br>
A mind at peace with all below, </br>
A heart whose love is innocent! </br>
