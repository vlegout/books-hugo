<p>
Out of the night that covers me,<br />
Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
I thank whatever gods may be<br />
For my unconquerable soul.<br />
</p>

<p>
In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br />
</p>

<p>
Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />
Looms but the horror of the shade,<br />
And yet the menace of the years<br />
Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br />
</p>

<p>
It matters not how strait the gate,<br />
How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />
I am the master of my fate:<br />
I am the captain of my soul.<br />
</p>
